        <h1>Removal of HBAC Deny Rules.</h1>
        <p>FreeIPA has dropped support for DENY rules from the HBAC
          specification. </p>
        <p>The former design of HBAC specifies that<p>
           <ol>
             <li> If no ALLOW rules match, access is denied</li>
             <li> If one or more ALLOW rules match and no DENY rules match,
               access is  allowed</li>
             <li>If one or more DENY rules match, access is denied</li>
           </ol>
        <p>Thus, DENY rules exist only to provide exceptions from the ALLOW
          rules. There exists no ALLOW+DENY combination that cannot be
          constructed from ALLOW rules only.[1]</P>

        <p>DENY rules introduce a lot of edge-cases for evaluation. The most
          important of which is the availability of the group membership for
          the user logging in. Depending on the mechanism used to log in (for
          example, GSSAPI over SSH or cross-realm Kerberos trust where the
          user is provided by the PAC), SSSD's cache may not have a complete
          list of groups for this user. If the login is occurring during
          offline mode (where SSSD cannot contact the LDAP server to refresh
          the user's groups), SSSD cannot determine whether DENY rules would
          match for the user. This therefore translates into a potential
          security issue.</p>

        <p>We implemented a workaround in the SSSD evaluator to resolve this by
          guaranteeing that we do a full lookup of all groups referenced by
          rules while we are retrieving the rules from FreeIPA. However, this
          requires at least one additional lookup against the LDAP server
          (possibly many if there is need to resolve nestings). This results
          in a significantly slower login while online.</p>

        <p>We also have issues related to source host evaluation. Some
          applications will provide an IP address instead of a hostname in the
          pam_rhost attribute. Our only recourse here is to perform a
          reverse-DNS lookup to try and identify the real hostname(s) of the
          server. However, in many real-world environments, reverse DNS is
          unavailable or misconfigured. In the case of ALLOW rules, this would
          lead to a match failure and an implicit denial. However, a failure
          to properly match a DENY rule can result in unexpected access being
          granted. This is a potentially serious security issue.</p>

        <p>Given these edge cases (and performance issues of the noted
          workaround),  The FreeIPA team decided to drop DENY rules from the
          HBAC specification and   limit HBAC only to ALLOW rules (which are
          much safer). Beyond the obvious advantages for our implementation,
          this should make it less complex for users to write their rules.</p>

        <p>[1] Some rules are complex to simulate, such as "Allow access from
          all PAM services EXCEPT telnet". But a safer and clearer
          implementation approach does all access via whitelist. If a FreeIPA
          implementation  is using an exception rule, the administrators
          should re-evaluate the justification.
